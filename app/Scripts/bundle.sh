# the Info.plist is what carries LSUIElement (no Dock icon, no app switcher)
# and, more importantly, what gives the app its own TCC identity. Run as a bare
# executable, microphone permission attaches to whatever terminal launched it,
# which is why the original spike asked you to grant Terminal mic access by
# hand. A bundle gets its own entry in System Settings.

# Ad-hoc unless SIGN_ID names a real identity. Ad-hoc signatures change on every
# build, so macOS may re-ask for the microphone after a rebuild; a Developer ID
# keeps one permission across rebuilds. Note that switching between the two
# makes this a *different app* to TCC — an existing grant does not carry over.
#
# The entitlements are not optional. The hardened runtime gates the microphone
# on com.apple.security.device.audio-input before TCC is consulted, so signing
# with --options runtime and no entitlements produces an app that cannot record
# and cannot ask to.
#
# Sign inside out, and not with --deep. sonocles-cli is an executable living in
# Contents/Resources, which --deep treats as a resource rather than as nested
# code — so it kept the ad-hoc signature SwiftPM's linker gave it, and the
# notary service rejected the whole archive for it: no Developer ID, no secure
# timestamp, no hardened runtime. `codesign --verify --deep --strict` reports
# such a bundle as valid, so local verification will not catch this. Only
# notarisation will.
