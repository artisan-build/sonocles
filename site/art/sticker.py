"""
The sticker cut, ported from rheocles/site/art/sticker.py. A generated plate
arrives on its own flat cream, never quite the site's --stone, so on the
page each one reads as a slightly-off rectangle. This lifts the drawing off
that cream so it sits directly on the page: flood-fill the background to
transparency from the four edges, soften the one-pixel edge, trim to the
drawing plus a constant margin, and write the result with alpha to
src/assets/plates/, where index.astro imports it.

    python3 site/art/sticker.py             # every plate in art/originals
    python3 site/art/sticker.py hero mic    # just those

Post-processing, not regeneration: art/originals/ holds the plates as
art/make.py wrote them (the repo-root art/plates/ is the retired museum set,
not these), and this runs after it. It is idempotent from the originals, so
running it twice is the same as running it once. Needs Pillow, numpy and
scipy — a throwaway venv, or `python3 -m pip install --user pillow numpy
scipy`; they are not the site's dependencies and do not belong in
package.json.

The fill only follows the background inward from the edges, so a cream area
enclosed by an outline (a tablet, a tunic, the theatre's rings) is left
alone. A gap in an outline lets the fill leak into such an area and leaves a
hole; the fix is a tighter TOLERANCE for that plate, below. A drawing that
touches the frame cannot be helped here — it needs regenerating with
everything inside the frame (art/make.py's style block asks for that) — so
it goes in SKIP and ships on its rectangle, `boxed` in Plate.astro, rather
than as half a sticker.
